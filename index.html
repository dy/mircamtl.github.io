		The Russian Cultural Exchange is a startup initiative that promotes Russian culture in Montreal. It works with local businesses from the Russian-speaking world to create a place where Russian speakers and enthusiasts can mingle, network and share information about the Russian world, its culture and history.
		</p>

		<p>
		Our mission is to create a centre to facilitate a deeper understanding of the various aspects of the past and present Russian world.
		</p>

		<p>
		All events are open to students of Russian language, native Russians-speakers, francophones, anglophones, and anyone else who is interested in learning something about the Russian world. It is not necessary to know how to speak Russian in order to participate in our events.
		</p>

		<p>
		Our events include: bi-monthly Russian conversation club for all levels; culinary events; Russian holiday celebrations; literature readings and film screenings; speaker series featuring scholars from McGill University, Concordia University, UdeM, and UQAM who specialize in various aspects of Russian arts, culture and history.
